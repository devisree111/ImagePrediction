ImageAI provides 4 different algorithms and model types to perform image prediction. To perform image prediction on any picture, take the following simple steps. The 4 algorithms provided for image prediction include SqueezeNet, ResNet, InceptionV3 and DenseNet. Each of these algorithms have individual model files which you must use depending on the choice of your algorithm. To download the model file for your choice of algorithm, click on any of the links below: 

- SqueezeNet (Size = 4.82 mb, fastest prediction time and moderate accuracy) 
- ResNet50 by Microsoft Research (Size = 98 mb, fast prediction time and high accuracy) 
- InceptionV3 by Google Brain team (Size = 91.6 mb, slow prediction time and higher accuracy) 
- DenseNet121 by Facebook AI Research (Size = 31.6 mb, slower prediction time and highest accuracy) 

Great! Once you have downloaded this model file, start a new python project, and then copy the model file to your project folder where your python files (.py files) will be . Download the image below, or take any image on your computer and copy it to your python project's folder. Then create a python file and give it a name; an example is FirstPrediction.py. Then write the code below into the python file:
